## Hello 👋

My name is Tanguy BARTHELEMY. I am a time series methodologist at [Insee](https://github.com/InseeFr) 🇫🇷. I work with [Anna Smyk](https://github.com/annasmyk) on Seasonal Adjustment tools and methods, and mainly on the [JDemetra+](https://github.com/jdemetra) software.

## Programming part 💻

I work mainly in R. My role is to maintain, improve and document the following packages:

- [JDCruncheR](https://github.com/InseeFr/JDCruncheR): Easy access to the JDemetra+ cruncher (JWSACruncher) from R
- [rjdworkspace](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/rjdworkspace) on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjdworkspace/index.html): Manipulation of JDemetra+ workspace structure with R

But I also work on the R package of JDemetra+ :

- Version 2 : [RJDemetra](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjdemetra) on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJDemetra/index.html)
- And the new gallery in version 3: [rjd3toolkit](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3toolkit), [rjd3workspace](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3workspace), [rjd3providers](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3providers), [rjd3x13](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3x13), [rjd3tramoseats](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3tramoseats), [rjd3sts](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3sts), [rjd3stl](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3stl), [rjd3highfreq](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3highfreq), [rjd3x11plus](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3x11plus), [rjd3bench](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3bench), [rjd3filters](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3filters), [rjd3revisions](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3revisions), [rjd3nowcasting](https://github.com/rjdverse/rjd3nowcasting) and [ggdemetra3](https://github.com/AQLT/ggdemetra3) (developped by [Alain Quartier-La-Tente](https://github.com/AQLT))

### JDemetra+ documentation 📖

With Anna Smyk, we also write the [documentation](https://jdemetra-new-documentation.netlify.app/) of the JDemetra+ software. You can follow us on our [blog](https://jdemetra-universe-blog.netlify.app/).

### JD Tutorials ▶️

In parallel with the documentation, I develop the [JD Tutorials](https://github.com/TanguyBarthelemy/JD_Tutorials) project which offers tutorials to discover JDemetra+, the GUI and the R packages. These tutorials are in the form of sheets or videos on our 🎥 [youtube channel (@TSwithJDemetraandR)](https://www.youtube.com/@TSwithJDemetraandR).
