## Hello 👋

My name is Tanguy BARTHELEMY. I am a time series methodologist at [Insee](https://github.com/InseeFr) 🇫🇷. I work with [Anna Smyk](https://github.com/annasmyk) on Seasonal Adjustment tools and methods, and mainly on the [JDemetra+](https://github.com/jdemetra) software.

I work mainly with R. My role is to maintain, improve and document the packages. 
In particular, I work on packages linked to JDemetra+ :
